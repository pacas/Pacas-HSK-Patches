  <ReviaRaceBackstoryAdultAcolyte.baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] is an acolyte of the bloody god of the Revia. [PAWN_pronoun] often sacrifices animals, humanlikes or any other living creature that [PAWN_pronoun] can get a hold of.

  <ReviaRaceBackstoryAdultAssassin.titleShort>Assassin</ReviaRaceBackstoryAdultAssassin.titleShort>
  <ReviaRaceBackstoryAdultAssassin.baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] was a weapon to silence whoever they were pointed at.

  <ReviaRaceBackstoryAdultDarkTemplar.baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] is a part of the higher echelons of the dark god's priesthood.

  <ReviaRaceBackstoryAdultFleshBinder.baseDescription>There are few healers in Revian society, but those that are healers earn the begrudging trust of the others. [PAWN_nameDef] apprenticed under other acolytes, learning the functions of various body parts as [PAWN_pronoun] sees them extracted from sacrifices.

  <ReviaRaceBackstoryAdultShadowGuard.baseDescription>There is one law in Revian worlds, and that is the rule of the strong. Defending one's property is typically undertaken in person.

  <ReviaRaceBackstoryChildApprenticeCraftsman.baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] spent [PAWN_possessive] days at the great forges, learning how to shape wood and metal.

  <ReviaRaceBackstoryChildExpunged.titleShort>Exile</ReviaRaceBackstoryChildExpunged.titleShort>
  <ReviaRaceBackstoryChildExpunged.baseDescription>Revian priests inspect newborn children for infirmities, and those that were found weak are exposed to weather until they die.

  <ReviaRaceBackstoryChildNeophyte.baseDescription>The lucky few who are taken in by the priesthood in Revian society are well cared for, and typically want for nothing. However, their days are filled with memorisation of litanies and chanting of prayers, as well as researching matters of the mundane and the occult. [PAWN_nameDef] was one such child. [PAWN_possessive] physical prowess lagged behind, yet [PAWN_possessive] mind grew by leaps and bounds.</ReviaRaceBackstoryChildNeophyte.baseDescription>

  <ReviaRaceBackstoryChildSacrificial.baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] was considered to be inferior in physical prowess. [PAWN_pronoun] was slated to be sacrificed on the altar of the moon, but [PAWN_pronoun] managed to escape [PAWN_possessive] holding cell.
