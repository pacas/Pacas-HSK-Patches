        <description>Revia are near-human females with vulpine traits. Beautiful, aggressive and with a natural sadistic precision, they thrive in close combat with their devastating jaws and claws, and are immensely empowered by sacrifice to their bloody goddess; the amount of sacrifice coinciding directly to the number of white-tipped tails a Revia has. Their fanatical bloodthirsty worship of a bloody goddess, aggressive warlike nature and the innate danger of creatures who get more powerful through killing others, causes fear in the section of the galaxy they inhabit despite their natural beauty.\n\n Accepting only her absolute law in their minds: the strong live and prosper, and the weak serve the strong in whatever way they are able. The Bloody Goddess' power is attained through the blood of others, and in her name the Revia will bleed the enemies of Skarne of every last drop! Blood, blood, blood!</description>
